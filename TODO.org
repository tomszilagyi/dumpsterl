Dataspec rewrite

The purpose of this rewrite: create a durable, extendable and
user-friendly framework for data exploration in NoSQL environments.

** generalized and pluggable type system
- count parent categories and imbedded categories, too
- count skipped rows, too (where accessor throws)
- allow dynamic subtypes to have further subtypes
  ie. allow types() to contain something like:
    { {tuple, '_'}, ... } %% subtypes for any (concrete) size tuple
** standard and pluggable spec format
- also for programmatic report creation
** advanced features for data mining
- sampling
- tag each data with arbitrary attributes
  - timestamp (when was this data created)
  - key (to read back the whole record)
